Test elcgpwr() by running elcgdots.
This test requires X Windows.

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

The parameter is a unique password.

Usage: elcgdots password

Example:

./elcgdots abcd
./elcgdots efgh

The tst.sh script runs 4 instances of elcgdots in parallel.
There are no parameters.

./tst.sh

The output from elcgdots is a random bitmap pattern of pixels 
on an X Windows screen, 512x512.  To quit press 'q'.

The output from tst.sh is 4 random bitmap patterns of pixels 
on X Windows screens, 512x512.  To quit press 'q' on each screen.

Raw Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates how a raw stream of random data is piped
into a down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a summary report.
This is a long running test.  To interrupt press CTRL-C.
The first test takes a half minute to print a report.

This is a randomness test for the random number generator in
